                <h1>Kamakura, Japan</h1>
                <p> Last December 2024, my family and I had the chance to visit Japan for 2 weeks! We went to iconic
                    cities such as Osaka, Kyoto, Nara, Tokyo, and Hakone, all of which were amazing. Having the chance
                    to live in smaller cities such as Park City in Utah, and White Sulphur Springs in West Virginia, I
                    have developed a soft spot for cities outside the metro – there’s just a certain charm to it that I
                    really love. <br><br>

                    Which brings us to Kamakura, a lovely little town just about two hours away from Tokyo by train. We
                    left around 5 AM and made our way to this quaint little spot called <b><i>Yoridokoro Café</b></i>.
                    They
                    are known for their simple, freshly caught fish off the coast. Their breakfast set came with a fresh
                    egg,
                    small dish, and a tiny whisk to beat the egg whites into a fluffy perfection for your rice – it was
                    such an amazing start to our day!<br><br>

                    After brunch, we headed over to Kamakurakokomae Station, where we got to see the famous railway
                    crossing for the opening scene of Slam Dunk. It wasn’t as crowded as we anticipated it to be, so we
                    had plenty of time to take in the scenery and capture some great videos! It was definitely a fun
                    activity for anime fans!<br><br>

                    Next, we headed over to Kotoku-In to see the Great Buddha. Outside the temple, there were a lot of
                    food stalls offering all kinds of treats and we surely won’t leave without trying a few – like the
                    famous matcha spaghetti ice cream, dango (grilled rice dumpling), and some freshly grilled
                    seafood!<br><br>

                    Kamakura was definitely one of the highlights of our trip. If you are visiting Tokyo, I highly
                    recommend seeing Kamakura! Next time, I’d love to stay overnight so we can further explore nearby
                    cities such as Enoden, where the famous lighthouse is located! Kamakura really
                    gave us a glimpse of a quieter, more traditional side of Japan, and it’s a memory I’ll always
                    cherish.<br><br>

                <h1>Sequoia National Park, California</h1>
                <p>
                    Last November 2024, my family visited us from the Philippines, and they really wanted to see the
                    West Coast! Our itinerary included Utah, Arizona, Las Vegas, and California. I’ve always wanted to
                    see the giant Sequoia trees, so this trip was the perfect opportunity to check that off our
                    list!<br><br>

                    The long drive from Las Vegas was already an adventure in itself, which took us almost 7 hours to
                    get there! We traversed some of the highest elevations we’ve been to – at one point being around
                    15,000 feet! The roads were quite scary, there were many winding curves (some even without
                    guardrails), so it’s not for the faint heart, but trust me it’s all worth it!<br><br>

                    Pictures really do not do justice on how beautiful everything in the park was! Seeing the General
                    Sherman Tree, the largest living thing on Earth was definitely the highlight of this visit. The park
                    ranger also told us how the General Sherman represents the perfect height, width, and age, with some
                    of its branches being bigger than the other trees in the park. As I stood next to it, I felt
                    incredibly small, humbled by its complete grandeur – a true testament to the wonders of nature
                    indeed!<br><br>

                <h1>Chilliwack, British Columbia</h1>
                <p>
                    April 2024, Justin surprised me with a trip to see the “Tulip Festival” in the Chilliwack, BC! I was
                    excited to see the fields filled with my favourite flower and we were just in time before the end of
                    tulip season (last week of April).<br><br>

                    The day pass was about $15 per adult, and there were plenty of souvenirs to choose from, including
                    fresh
                    bouquets of flowers and refrigerator magnets! It was a bit gloomy when we arrived, but the fields of
                    flowers were still amazing. We saw different varieties of tulips, along with some daffodils and
                    hyacinths for added assortment! On top of that already breathtaking view, you can also see the
                    mountain
                    range in the background - imagine how picturesque!<br><br>

                    After that, we found a small little restaurant offering poke bowl. Those were Hawaiian-inspired rice
                    bowls with fresh, raw fish! I got the mix of salmon, tuna, and scallops, and it was one of the best
                    poke
                    bowls I’ve ever had. So fresh and delicious!<br><br>

                    After our amazing day, we took a short drive to our hotel in Harrison Hot Springs BC. This quaint
                    lakeside town is known for its local restaurants, and of course, you guessed it, hot springs – which
                    is
                    a story for another day!<br><br>
